## Overview

In the realm of oncology research, emulating clinical trials using
real-world data presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing
with missing data and the need for careful propensity score analyses.
The `encore.analytics` package addresses these challenges by providing a
comprehensive toolkit that bridges the gap between multiple imputation
and propensity score methodologies.

### Why encore.analytics?

Real-world oncology data often suffers from missing values, requiring
sophisticated imputation techniques. When combined with propensity score
analyses for treatment effect estimation, the complexity increases
substantially. Traditional approaches often handle these challenges
separately, leading to potential biases and methodological
inconsistencies.

The `encore.analytics` package offers an integrated solution that:

- Maintains the proper order of operations between imputation and
  propensity score estimation
- Ensures consistent handling of uncertainty across multiple imputed
  datasets
- Provides specialized tools for oncology-specific outcomes and metrics

The package implements various methodologies for:

- Multiple imputation of missing data
- Propensity score estimation and matching
- Survival analysis with multiply imputed data
- Agreement metrics for assessing consistency across imputed datasets
- Specialized visualization tools for survival outcomes

## Key Features

- **Cox Model Pooling**: Implementation of various approaches for
  pooling Cox proportional hazards models across multiply imputed
  datasets
- **Kaplan-Meier Pooling**: Tools for combining and visualizing
  Kaplan-Meier curves from multiple imputations
- **Raking Weights**: Methods for calibrating weights in propensity
  score analyses
- **Agreement Metrics**: Functions to assess consistency and agreement
  across imputed datasets
- **Table 1 Generation**: Utilities for creating descriptive statistics
  tables
- **Data Simulation**: Tools for generating synthetic datasets for
  testing and validation

## Installation

You can install the development version of encore.analytics from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("janickweberpals/encore.analytics")
